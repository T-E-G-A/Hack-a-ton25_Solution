# Heron - AI-Driven Zero-Emissions Energy Optimization System

## Project Overview
Heron is an AI-driven, zero-emissions energy optimization system developed by Team WaveZero during the Hack-a-Ton 2025, hosted by the ARU STEM Society. Our innovative approach to enhancing energy efficiency and security at Anglia Ruskin University’s Chelmsford campus earned us 3rd place in the competition.

One of the most successful times I "hacked" a non-computer system to my advantage was during Hack-a-Ton 2025, my first-ever hackathon. Despite having little prior knowledge of mechanical engineering, I used my problem-solving skills, ability to analyze systems, and strategic thinking to help my team, WaveZero, secure 3rd place in the competition.

The challenge was to develop an integrated solution that synchronizes heating and lighting to minimize energy waste and improve indoor comfort at Anglia Ruskin University’s Chelmsford campus. Instead of tackling the problem purely from a technical or mechanical perspective, I focused on user engagement, security, financial feasibility, and sustainability—all critical aspects of our final solution, Heron.

## Key Features
- **Voice Recognition with SpeechMatics Flow API**: Enhanced staff onboarding security and energy control through advanced voice recognition technology.
- **Hierarchical Access Model**: Provided role-based customization, ensuring different user groups had access to relevant system features.
- **Automated Heating and Lighting Control**: Dynamically adjusted based on real-time occupancy and environmental factors.
- **Sustainable Energy Use**: Leveraged solar energy with battery storage and inverter systems.
- **Financial Impact**: Estimated a 20-40% reduction in energy costs, leading to annual savings of £150,000–£300,000, with a full return on investment within 3-6 years.
- **Sustainability Impact**: Achieved potential savings of 265 tonnes of CO2—equivalent to the annual energy use of 100 average UK households or 158 cars—resulting in £1,568,758 in cost reductions.

## Why Heron?
What made this experience a great example of "hacking" a non-computer system was how we:
- ✔ Approached the problem from multiple perspectives—not just engineering, but also security, financial feasibility, and user experience.
- ✔ Designed a scalable solution that could integrate with other smart campus systems and renewable energy sources.
- ✔ Optimized for both technical feasibility and financial viability, ensuring the solution was cost-effective and could be implemented in the real world.

Despite initial gaps in mechanical engineering knowledge, we developed a high-impact, practical, and scalable solution that combined AI, automation, and sustainability—demonstrating our ability to identify inefficiencies, innovate within constraints, and strategically "hack" systems to achieve success.
